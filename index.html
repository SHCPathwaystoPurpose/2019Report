Attendees are asked to dive into their own vocational discernment and discuss the numerous facets of what makes a meaningful life. At the end of the retreat, faculty and staff consider how their experience at the retreat might be shared when they return to campus, both with colleagues and with students. </p>

               <h2>Course Development Stipends</h2>
              <p>Six faculty were awarded with course development stipends in fall 2018 to attend a workshop to develop a new course, or rework an existing course, that would focus, at least partially, on vocational discernment. These courses would have a content area related to the faculty's expertise, but also insert at least 2 activities that would help students as they discern their ideas about vocation.
